G.O.B.B.I. is a suit of mechanical armor created by [Seg](index).

He looks like a humanoid dragon, with a tail, fangs, and horns. He is primarily made out of polished stone and metal, with onyx accents. He stands at 6'8". When Seg speaks, his voice is modulated and filtered so that you would not be able to tell that it is Seg talking. He is fully equipped with an array of weapons and tools, anything that Seg might need. When Seg wants to enter the cockpit, G.O.B.B.I.'s chest opens up and the cockpit is lowered down to the ground so he can easily enter.
