Abathos Polyphemus Anthorian the Giant and his Warforged Machine for Learning and Articulation are two members of the Anthorian family. Abathos was the only child of Mozzus and [[Jator Anthorian]], and the Machine for Learning and Articulation (lovingly called "Pal" by Abathos) was constructed to teach Abathos. Abathos' father, as he was the Young King's advisor, has access to the more advanced technologies of Giant king, so Pal is a one of a kind, advanced machine.

Abathos and Pal grew up and were inseparable. Pal taught Abathos everything he needed to know about Giant culture, as well as reading and writing. Pal also acted as a bodyguard for Abathos when needed, protecting him on some of his adventures around the hills.

At the age of 23, Abathos wanted to see the world and, after much convincing from his father, he and Pal set out on a journey of a lifetime. Abathos was extremely young, but he had Pal with him, and the two took a trip around the entirety of Faerun. It was on this excursion that they ran into the Kobold [[index|Seg]]. After returning from their year-long journey, they were hungry for more. Jator agreed that they could go out again, but this time he gave him errands. This continued year after year, with Abathos becoming a sort of adventurer, searching for materials, artifacts, and pieces of Giant history that his father or the Young King desired.
