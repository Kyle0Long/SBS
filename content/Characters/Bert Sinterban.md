Bert Sinterban is a Kobold, part of the [[Troll Mountain Kobold Tribe]] mining troupe. He and [[index|Seg]] grew up in the mining academy together. Bert was perfectly content with being a miner and helping out the tribe.

When he found Seg playing with rocks rather than mining, he really just found it funny. He and the other miners laughed and made fun of him for about a week and a half, and then they all forgot about it. In fact, none of them could recall the incident after a month or two. They all just saw Seg as a strange outsider, but they held no animosity towards him.

He found the confrontation to be hysterical until the incident, then it just became sad. He did not want Seg to be so severely punished, but he knew that it was right to send him away. Bert pitied Seg.
