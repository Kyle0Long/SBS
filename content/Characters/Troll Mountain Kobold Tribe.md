This is a tribe of mining Kobolds that resides in the Troll Mountains. They live in a colony dug out inside of one of the Northern mountains in the range. Their society is very corporate and class-based. Everyone in the tribe is required to train to become a miner for many years, and then join the workforce. Everyone works together to mine various minerals. Miners work to move up the ranks, which improves their stake in the tribe and their wages. They mostly receive food, but they also receive gemstones once they reach a certain level. These gems are used for trading, but their society does not have much of an economy. People eat their waged meals, go to bed, and get up to go to work yet again the next day.

It is a monotonous existence, but the Kobolds are devoted to the tribe.

Almost every resident never even sees the outside, only a select few are able to go out, trading their minerals for various supplies that the tribe requires. They purchase food and more tools, if needed. It is not seen as an honor to go to the outside world. It is honorable to purchase supplies, since it helps the tribe, but anyone who wants to leave the mountain is shamed and shunned. Exiles are extra shameful, since you are not only forced to leave, but stay in the outside world.
