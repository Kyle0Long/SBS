[[index|Seg]] woke up late one night and went to an empty, abandoned shaft. He dug out more area, creating a workshop of sorts, and ensured that it was hidden from sight. Starting the next day, he began brainstorming ways to get back at [[Bert Sinterban|Bert]]. By the end of his shift, he knew what he must do. Seg dreamt up a suit of armor made of rock and stone. He would create this suit, however long it took, and wear it to work, humiliating Bert in front of everyone. Surely this would be the revenge needed.

Everyday, just like before, Seg would clock in, now heading to his secluded workshop to work on the suit of armor. He started out with simple armor, but he decided that this was not good enough. He added large gauntlets that could crash through stone, but while developing this, he realized that it could use spring-loaded legs that would allow him to jump further. While building the springs, he thought that it would even more terrifying if the mask had jagged teeth. This same process of creating a feature that spawned one or more additional design choices continued for five years. Finally, on Seg's 30th birthday, he was finished. The suit had evolved into a fully mechanized battle suit. It stood at 5'6" (Seg was 1'8" at the time), was equipped with numerous weapons, and it was completely controlled by a cockpit at the center of the machine. [[G.O.B.B.I.|G.O.B.B.I. 1.0]] (though unnamed at the time) was finally ready to show to the world.

Seg took his machine, piloting out of his workshop and squeezing through mining crevasses until he found the rest of shift breaking for lunch. He lumbered into the cave where they were eating and shouted, "Beeert! After all of your torment I have finally come for payback!"

The room was filled with the sound of confused murmurs, and after a few awkward seconds Bert piped up. "What are you talking about?"

"You don't remember the humiliation you put me through?"

"Uhh..." Bert paused, "Can't say I do."

"You called me names, turned everyone against me. All anyone could talk about was me after you shamed me in front of the whole tribe. I could hear all of you. Every conversation, every word. 'Rockman this.' 'Foolish that.' You found me completely incapable, but I've bode my time and now I have come to return the favor."

Bert and the other Kobolds around him looked at each other. Some began to look down, stifling laughs. "Dude," Bert said with a confused chuckle, "what are you talking about?"

Seg coldly stared at Bert for a few seconds, processing what just happened. Five years of rigorous work: designing, testing, and building an instrument designed completely for revenge, and nobody even knew. They had tormented him for years, never letting up once. He was never included, always on the outskirts, and it was all Bert's fault. Bert must have put them up to this. He told all of them to act like it was nothing, even though they were all conspiring together. It all made sense.

Filled with rage, Seg yelled and beat on the controls on the console in front of him. Right as all the onlookers had just enough time to start judging, the impacts had fried the machine's inner workings. The suit began to act on its own: flailing about and unloading every weapon it had on both the cave and its inhabitants. After the dust settled, Kobolds, tables, and food were strewn about the entire cave. Seg was humiliated, and his coworkers took action.

[[The Mining Council]] held a trial for Seg where they tried him for not only the damages to their mine. During the trial, Seg's habits at the workplace came to light, and he was found to have missed work every day for 5 years straight. His various crimes led to a unanimous decision from the Council. Seg was to take his suit of armor and be forced into [[Exile|exile]]. He packed up his things and was thrown out immediately. Nobody said goodbye, and Seg had never felt more betrayed.
